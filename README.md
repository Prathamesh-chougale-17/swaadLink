## About the Project

### Motivation
The idea behind Swaadlink is to bridge the gap between talented chefs and food enthusiasts who crave customized culinary experiences.

- **Enhance User Experience**: Offer users a seamless way to find, filter, and book chefs based on their specific preferences and needs.
- **Promote Local Cuisine**: Support local chefs and promote diverse culinary traditions.

## Features

- **Chef Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles featuring chef specialties, experience, ratings, reviews, and availability.
- **Real-time Booking System**: An integrated booking system that allows users to schedule chefs for specific dates and times, with instant confirmation.
- **Efficient Search & Filtering**: Advanced search and filtering options to help users find the perfect chef based on cuisine, availability, location, price range, and more.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management for predictable and consistent application behavior.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling for a modern and responsive UI.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend API.
  
### Database:
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing chef profiles, user data, bookings, and more.

### Other Tools:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For hashing passwords before storing them in the database.

## Architecture

The application follows a classic three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**: Developed with React.js and Redux, responsible for rendering the UI and handling user interactions.
2. **Application Layer (Backend)**: Built using Node.js and Express.js, this layer handles business logic, API routing, and communication with the database.
3. **Data Layer (Database)**: MongoDB stores all the data, including user information, chef profiles, bookings, and reviews.

The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs, while the backend interacts with the MongoDB database to perform CRUD operations.
